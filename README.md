# Image-Classification with Random Forest


an example script if you want to do image-classification stuff with Random Forest. The datasets are available at [cell_images](ftp://lhcftp.nlm.nih.gov/Open-Access-Datasets/Malaria/cell_images.zip). Please download so you can follow the script.

## Workflow

Here is a quick brief of the project workflow.
