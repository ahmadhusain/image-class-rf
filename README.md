# Image-Classification with Random Forest


an example script if you want to do image-classification stuff with Random Forest. The datasets are available at Malaria Dataset [cell_images.zip](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LHC-downloads/downloads.html). Please download so you can follow the script.

## Workflow

Here is a quick brief of the project workflow.
